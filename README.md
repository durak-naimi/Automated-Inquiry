# Automated-Inquiry

The project aims to utilize Azure AI features to automated customer enquiry system in travel industry (Indian Railway)
Artificial Intelligence can be used to automate Manual enquiry system by featuring Azure AI services.
For the purpose of project we have utilised 3 Azure AI services - Azure Speech, LUIS and QnA maker

The AI powered system aims on 2 objectives.
a. Similar to manually operated system
b. Simple to use

By leveraging Azure Speech and LUIS, first objective has been achieved. As the system takes in input from user in spoken format and using LUIS it correctly utilises the intent of
the user such as (GetPlatform, GetTime, GetTrain)

By leveraging QnA maker, second objective is achieved as the system can be updated real time by editing excel sheet and uploading it as knowledge base to QnA maker. This process
Takes hardly a minute. Moreover the system does not require any coding once it is up and running, data entry is the only requiement which makes it very easy to operate.
